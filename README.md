# Github-Practice
1. Clone sets origin to a reference to the remote repo
2. git branch --set-upstream origin main sets the default remote branch to main for the current local branch; remote tracking branches are references to the state of remote branches
3. In the commit tree, it pulls from origin and master and then merges them together in the local branch
4.  Unless you force pull, it will not overwrite the commit
5.  Merge
6.  No, it is still behind the remote master
